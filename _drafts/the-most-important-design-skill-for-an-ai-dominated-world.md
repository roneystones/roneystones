designers should see the rise of AI as an opportunity to focus their attention on the types of skills that algorithms don’t have.

algorithms are based on historical data, which is often flawed and biased against people who aren’t white or male

When those algorithms use biased, discriminatory datasets to find patterns–and make decisions based on those patterns–they will ignore large swaths of the population

That’s where Maeda sees an opening for designers. “Computers aren’t good at inclusion,” he says. “They’re good at exclusion, because they’re only based on past data. The business opportunity for the future-thinking designer is in inclusion.”

He takes the recent blockbuster success of Black Panther as an example. “When you look at the data, there’s no reason why a movie with a black superhero is going to be super successful,” he says. “AI isn’t going to tell you that.”

Inclusive design has proven its business value in myriad industries.

“When you are inclusive, there’s a huge design opportunity to make better products, which leads to more successful business,” Maeda says.
