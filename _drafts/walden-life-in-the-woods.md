Walden: Life in the Woods

Thoreau was concerned that modern life was offering little opportunity for gaining real wisdom and knowledge. People were crushed under the servitude of work and had little chance of enjoying what life had to offer. To Thoreau, the move to Walden represented a return to the simple life.

Thoreau’s Walden routine meant boiling things down to the bare essentials so he could stay focused on more enlightened pursuits – and in doing so, devote himself to philosophical, spiritual, creative and artistic endeavors. The simple life came down to four essentials: food, shelter, clothing, and fuel for the fireplace or woodstove.

It was amongst this sonorous wash of animal life that Thoreau began to see his solitude in the woods as an immersive experience in nature.

## About the book:

Walden (1854) is the result of the two years Henry David Thoreau spent in the woods on the north shore of Walden Pond, a lake in Massachusetts. It is both a practical and philosophical account of how he sustained himself through farming and by building his own house, and what he learned about human nature by living a simpler life. Although it was a deeply personal experience, Thoreau’s approach to society teaches us how we, too, can approach the modern world.
