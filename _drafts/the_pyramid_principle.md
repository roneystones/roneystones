The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking

## Organize seu pensamento em forma de pirâmide antes de começar a escrever.
          
people automatically attempt to organize information in any written document into a certain form, namely a top-down pyramid shape, where conclusions are supported by justifications and arguments, much like a pyramid is supported by its cornerstones.
          
A top-down pyramid structure means that the document first introduces a summary statement and then the reasoning behind it.
           
## Build your pyramid: group similar ideas together and then summarize each group with one statement.
          
Repeat the process on the next level, and the next and so on. Eventually, you are left with one summary statement that crystallizes the key message of the entire document. Your pyramid is ready.
          
When constructing a pyramid, follow the bottom-up approach: First, list all the points you want to make, clustering together those that argue toward a similar conclusion. Then summarize each group with a single statement one level above the group. Each summary statement is like the tip of a miniature pyramid.  
          
Any idea expressed in the pyramid must always be a summary of the ideas grouped below it. Never use intellectually blank summary statements such as, “There are three reasons why we should expand to Austria.” This is lazy writing, as the author has not bothered to summarize the three reasons properly for the reader.  
          
Ideas in any grouping must be logically similar and share the same level of abstraction  
 
## Justifying statements: use deduction to derive conclusions from chains of premises.
          
Any statement you make within your pyramid structure must raise a question in the reader’s mind, which you then answer on the level below. One way this answer can be formulated is through deductive reasoning.
          
from a reader’s perspective, the premise-premise-conclusion order withholds the most interesting piece of information until the end.
          
When recommending action to your reader, consider flipping the order of your deduction so that you lead with your conclusion. After all, the recommendation is what the reader really cares about.
          
As a rule of thumb, recommendations benefit from the opposite order: “We should hire applicant A, because we need someone who can read, and he can.”  
          
While deductive reasoning is a very straight-forward and naturally flowing process, it should not be used in complex arguments where you need many backing layers of justifications to support your premises.
 
## Justifying statements: use induction to derive conclusions from groups of similar items.
          
Induction means drawing a conclusion from a set of ideas that are similar in some way; e.g. “Reasons for…” or “Parts of…”  
          
If your grouping is made up of recommended actions, you should order the points chronologically, according to which action you would take first.  
          
With induction, the logical order in which to present your supporting points is not as obvious as with deduction. To make it intuitive for the reader, the order should always be determined by the source of the grouping.
          
## MECE-logic, where the parts are mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive.
 
To formulate recommendations, approach problems methodically and visualize them using logic trees.
          
First, you identify the problem in clear, measurable terms
          
Third, you dig deeper into the problem to find out why it exists   
          
Next, you find out exactly where the problem is
          
This allows you to identify possible courses of action to solve the problem 
 
## Structure recommendations around the effect they are meant to cause.
          
Essentially, when giving a recommendation, you make an action statement that describes the actions aimed at achieving a desired effect. This being the case, you should group your actions around the effect you are aiming for and describe the effect so tangibly that you will later know whether or not it has been achieved.
 
Use the introduction to tell the reader your key points within 30 seconds of reading.
          
You begin by describing the initial situation, after which you introduce a complication and finally offer a resolution.   
          
Every document should begin with a brief introduction that serves two purposes: to incite the reader’s interest in the document, and to set the stage for the problem to be solved.   
 
## Use headings and formatting to show your pyramid structure in the text.
          
Readers tend to skim headings, so do not rely on them to communicate the actual idea, but keep them short, only expressing the essence of the idea that follows. When using headings seems too rigid and formal, consider simply underlining the main point and supporting points, etc., within the text.

## About the book:     
Never has clear, convincing communication been as important as in today’s information-cluttered environment. The Pyramid Principle (1978) explains in detail how written documents and presentations can be logically structured, and the methods described in the book are used by almost every major management consultancy on the planet.

Barbara Minto is a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who now focuses on teaching the Pyramid Principle to some of the world’s largest corporations and government organizations.
As a consultant at McKinsey & Co, Minto realized that while most people could get the language of written documents right, many struggled with the clarity of the actual thinking behind them. She developed the Pyramid Principle to teach the foundations required for clear writing.
