Principles: Life and Work

it’s important to keep a realistic outlook on life. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that life won’t be messy and uncomfortable from time to time.

It’s important to choose the right goal and to keep learning and improving. Look to nature and evolution in order to keep your eye on the big picture.

the secret to good goal-setting is to prioritize and narrow things down.

Don’t ignore problems because they’re too personal and don’t underestimate a potential issue by being overly optimistic.

Radical truth extends to performance evaluations as well.

As most people overestimate their capabilities and the amount of work they do, performing accurate evaluations is essential to prevent problems.

Psychologists believe the biggest motivator for personal improvement is the pain you feel after making a mistake. When you feel so terrible about having done something wrong that you never want to feel that way again, it’s called “hitting bottom”

Flowcharts and metrics are great tools for enhanced performance. Metrics can provide a considerable boost to productivity, and since they’re unbiased, accurate and reliable, they’re perfectly suited to an environment that practices radical truth and transparency. With an accurate view of exactly what employees are doing, and how well they’re doing it, you’ll find that the job of supervision almost takes care of itself!

Build organizations from the top down and keep an eye on manager-to-employee ratios. It’s also wise to keep a balanced ratio of managers to staff. A good rule of thumb is not to exceed a ratio of ten to one.

## Summary

It’s very difficult to see where your blind spots are. So to identify them, keep a list of the circumstances surrounding bad decisions you’ve made in the past. You could ask other people – especially people who spotted what you missed – to help you in this endeavor. Tack this list up on the wall and look at it every time you’re considering making a decision in your blind-spot area. And don’t be afraid to consult others before moving forward.
