Portfolio review advice for graduating students:

- Never apologize for your work.
- Be able to explain your professional goals.
- Be able to explain why.
- Don't put in mediocre work to make your portfolio bigger.
- Put in the kind of work you want to be hired to do.
- Don't put in work you don’t care about.
- Ask questions.
- Confident but not arrogant.
- Be able to name a few favorite creators (this is surprisingly hard to do on the spot, have some names prepared.)
- Include esoteric, experimental, deep-dive work you are super excited about, even if it’s not “design” or perfectly finished.
- Take notes (you won't remember all the stuff later, believe me).
- Be able to discuss your concept/thinking process. You're also being hired for problem-solving skills. Only show your best work, work you're proud of & excited about. 
- Be passionate & enthusiastic. Have fun. Be yourself. 
- Also, talk. Have a conversation. Don’t just sit and wait for someone to tab through your website. Anyone with a blind email can do that, but having a point of view and good conversational skills are just as valuable as your talent.
- Explaining your design decisions in pivotal. I want confident people who believe in their work without being arrogant. Accept creative criticism at interviews. And learn from it.  Take us on a journey. Show workings. Show thought process. Pace your folio. (via @LimepickleLLC)
- Be humble & remind yourself this is just the beginning of a great journey. (via @Dazarbeygui)
- Equally important & often overlooked: ask for a biz card, too. I talk to many pros after networking event & they leave wishing more students asked for a card. (via @josephglennon)
