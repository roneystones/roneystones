The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9–5, Live Anywhere and Join the New Rich

## Write your own rules, and always aim high

Aiming high will set you apart from all those who think “realistically” and settle for mediocrity. In fact, since most people settle for good rather than aim for great, the competition for good goals is often far more fierce.“Unrealistic” things might be easier to accomplish than you think because only a few dare to think big. It’s often lonely at the top, meaning less competition for you.

## Take action today, and step outside your comfort zone

Staying within your comfort zone allows you to constantly lie to yourself so you can maintain a blind faith that everything is going to be good someday, somehow. This way of thinking is often mistakenly labeled as optimism, but in fact, it’s mental laziness. It comes from a fear of the challenges you must face if you want to achieve your big goals in life.

## Even as an employee, you can live the life of the New Rich

Make yourself indispensable. Have your company invest money into you, attend training and become an expert they can’t afford to lose.

## Be effective, not efficient: don’t do everything right, do the right things

Being productive means getting as much done as possible with as little work as possible. There’s no point being concerned with efficiency, which means getting things done as quickly as possible. Unimportant tasks are still unimportant even when you deal with them efficiently. Your time is better spent on important tasks – on being effective. Focus on only those tasks that will bring you closer to your personal goals and dreams.

## Time is money: get rid of time-thieves and go on a low-information diet

Meetings, for example, are like black holes where time and energy disappear, and most are completely unnecessary anyway. In fact, the only time a meeting is appropriate is when a decision calls for input from several people. If this is the case, make sure there is an agenda and a fixed schedule to keep participants focused on results and to stop them from babbling.

## Set up a business that brings a steady stream of income and works without you

Everyone has to be able to communicate with one another without you as an intermediary. Don’t make yourself a bottleneck in any part of the process.

Delegate responsibilities. People can solve most problems without your help if you just let them.

## Be a professional: act like one, and be picky about your customers

Give people the impression they are dealing with a company with many employees. For instance, provide several contact email addresses on your website. Use titles that sound like middle-management such as “head of customer support” to give the impression there’s a multi-layer hierarchy with lots of employees in the company.
