Project summaries short and sweet, with a sentence introducing the client and a quick overview of the project goals. But instead of leaving it at that and dumping a bunch of photos beneath, breaks it down and explains each piece of the project along the way.

Write down your case studies before you do almost anything else. it helps to get the hardest task out of the way first. 

Think of your project in phases and start with Phase 1, which is usually the ideation or exploration phase. Write down your thoughts, and then continue to Phase 2.

Keep it brief & caption everything. Don't write a novel, just share a short paragraph or two that makes your project interesting and relatable to your reader.

Include the right details: Name of client, what they do & Goal for the project. Give credit & explain your role. Write in your voice.
