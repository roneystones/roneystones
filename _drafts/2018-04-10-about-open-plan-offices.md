>Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory. They’re associated with high staff turnover. They make people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and insecure. Open-plan workers are more likely to argue more with their colleagues.

Most of the time hotdesks are even worse than open-plan offices. People like “owning” space to keep toys and can’t live without carrying loads of stuff with them. Now think of an introvert with noise sensitivity issues.

Maybe that's why many tech startups make poor decisions. The human brain can't operate at optimum level with multiple distractions.

>I hate my open plan office. My desk is connected to a desk thumper. Ruins my concentration constantly. &mdash; sore AF (@andrewfergusson) [https://twitter.com/andrewfergusson/status/983030447230914560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw] (8 de abril de 2018)

A desk thumper is someone who hits the table while working. Generally strong enough to shake monitors.

## Possible solution

A space of one's own. Excellent tools. Minimum distraction when working.
 
People need to have open spaces for collaboration and then a place to retreat to when they need to get individual work done. Personal space is also key. I suspect people who only hotdesk without any personal space in the workplace are under significantly more stress.
