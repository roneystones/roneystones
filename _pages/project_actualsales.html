	<p>Sometimes it is difficult to summarize a work routine in a simple job title. Some people would describe me as Creative Director or Lead Designer. The hipsters would suggest something like Full-Stack Designer. That's what the job descriptions are for.</p>

	<p>ActualSales is a huge Digital Marketing agency where <span class="destaque">I spent the first 5 years as a designer and the last 2 as team coordinator</span>. That means I mainly work with Landing Pages for Lead Generation and lots of AB Tests. The business model does not require deliverables like wireframes, sitemaps, or prototypes, but the strength is in speed, focus on conversion and metric-based decisions.</p>

	<p>Besides as Visual Designer, my work also included applying and following AB tests so that campaigns reach the best possible conversion rate.</p>
