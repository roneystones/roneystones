	<h2>Interviews</h2>
	<p>At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews in order to get a better understanding of the problem.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What were the research questions? What were you curious about the most?</li>
		<li>How many users did you interview?</li>
		<li>What were the main insights you got from the interviews?</li>
		<li>What did you change on the design based on the insights?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Surveys</h2>
	<p>After we launched the MVP, we wanted to gather feedback from the existing users. We set up an online survey and asked them fill it out.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What type of surveys did you use? (in dept, short, on-site, external)</li>
		<li>How many people have filled the survey? </li>
		<li>What results did you get?</li>
		<li>What decisions did you make based on the results?</li>
	</ul>
