  <p>I've always been a cross-disciplinary designer, so I work to maintain my skills in <span class="destaque">User Experience</span>, <span class="destaque">Visual Design</span> and <span class="destaque">Front-End Development</span>. Yes, I really enjoy keeping up with the creative ecosystem.</p>

  <p>I am also interested in Data Visualization, Data UX, Statistics, Philosophy, and Literature — I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/roneystones/learning-chest">repository</a> and an account in <a href="https://codepen.io/roneystones/">Codepen</a> with my studies. There you can find some experiments with Sass, Javascript, Gulp (soon Vue.js and D3.js) and others.</p>

  <div class="courses">
    <h2>Some courses and certificates</h2>
    
    <p>In 2006 I graduated in <span class="destaque">Design Digital at the Centro Universitário Íbero-americano</span>. Then I studied <span class="destaque">Information Architecture at the Instituto Faber-Ludens</span> and since then I have completed several online courses among the disciplines of UX, Design and Front-end. I listed below the most relevant:</p>

    <ul>
      {% for course in site.data.courses %}
        <li>
          <span>{{ course.curso }}</span>
          <span class="space"></span>
          <span>{{ course.onde }}</span>
          <!-- <a href="{{ course.link }}">{{ course.onde }}</a> -->
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>I truly believe that the term <span style="font-style: italic">'design'</span> is strong enough to translate every step of a creative process, from research to the delivery of a project. I may seem a little orthodox, but I think that many of the fancy job titles that we see today are the result of dangerous fragmentation or desperate professionals to stand out in some way.</p>
