  <h3>Data, User Experience & Visual Design</h3>
  <p>I've always been a cross-disciplinary designer - or what they call a "T-Shaped" profile - so I study constantly to be skilled in UX (research, wireframing), Design (visual, interaction) and Front-End Development (HTML, CSS, JS). I really enjoy to keep up with all the creative ecosystem.</p>

  <p>I truly believe that the term <span style="font-style: italic">design</span> is strong enough to translate every step of a creative process, from research to the delivery of a project. I may seem a bit orthodox, but many of the fancy job titles we see today are the result of a dangerous fragmentation or desperate professionals to stand out in some way.</p>

  <h3>I am also interested in ... (hobbies and studies)</h3>
  <p>Data Visualization, Data UX, Statistics, Philosophy, and Literature — I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/roneystones/learning-chest">repository</a> and an account in <a href="https://codepen.io/roneystones/">Codepen</a> with my studies, there you find some experiments with Sass, Javascript, Gulp (soon Vue.js and D3.js) and others.</p>

    <h2>Some courses and certificates</h2>
    
    <p>In 2006 I graduated in <b>Design Digital</b> at the Centro Universitário Íbero-americano. Then I studied <b>Information Architecture</b> at the Instituto Faber-Ludens and since then I have completed several online courses.</p>

    <p>I have listed here some that I consider being most relevant among the disciplines of UX, Design, Front-end, and Development:</p>

    <ul>
      {% for course in site.data.courses %}
        <li>
          <span>{{ course.curso }}</span>
          <span class="space"></span>
          <span>{{ course.onde }}</span>
          <!-- <a href="{{ course.link }}">{{ course.onde }}</a> -->
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
